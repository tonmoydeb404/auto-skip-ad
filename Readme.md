## Disclaimer:

While this script allows you to skip and mute ads after just 5 seconds, it's essential to remember that content creators rely on ad revenue to support their work. Blocking ads completely may harm the ecosystem that enables free content on the internet. This script offers a compromise to strike the right balance.

Enjoy a more seamless viewing experience while respecting the ethics of online content consumption.
